X<input type="text" #x /><br/>
Y<input type="text" #y /><br/>
<button type="button" (click)="Add(x.value,y.value)">Add</button><br/>
<!--it can only be as good as this, as accessing #x and #y from 
    the component class(the one with the component.ts file)
is harder than it looks as it involves using @ViewChild() decorator-->

<!--

    for better access of an html element, go for the two way binding instead
